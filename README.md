# 🚌 A Real-Time Bus Tracking Management System (SEC)

A smart, real-time GPS-based solution that tracks and monitors college buses through a live dashboard. This system enhances student safety and transport efficiency using real-time bus location updates, alerts, and route monitoring.

## 🌟 Overview

This project uses GPS + cloud technologies to:
- Track bus location in real-time
- Show bus routes & stop-wise ETA
- Provide a web dashboard for students & admins
- Send notifications for delays, breakdowns, or route changes
- Maintain student & bus data with secure authentication
- No manual tracking needed — just live updates from the bus to the screen.

## 🧠 Features

- Live map with bus markers
- ETA calculation for each stop
- Student login & assigned bus view
- Admin panel for bus, route & student management
- Notification & feedback management
- Firebase real-time location updates
- Secure DB for student transport records

from firebase import update_bus_location

BUS_NUMBER = "SEC_01"
route = [(13.0827, 80.2707), (13.0700, 80.2400), (13.0500, 80.2300)]

while True:
    for lat, lng in route:
        update_bus_location(BUS_NUMBER, lat, lng, speed=40)
        print("Location Updated:", lat, lng)
        sleep(5)
```

### 🌐 Frontend (React Dashboard)
```
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Runs at:
```
http://localhost:5173/
```
#### User View:
 - Live Map + Bus Tracking
 - ETA + Stop Information
 - Notifications
 - Feedback Form

### 📡 API Endpoints

#### Authentication
```
POST /api/auth/login
```

#### Bus Routes & Tracking
```
 GET  /api/buses
 GET  /api/buses/{bus_number}
 GET  /api/buses/{bus_number}/location
 POST /api/buses/{bus_number}/location   # GPS device update
```

- Admins can quickly detect issues (breakdowns, late departures) and take action.
- Improved Communication
- Notifications replace manual calling and guesswork.
- Transparency & Trust
- Parents gain confidence knowing their ward’s transport is monitored.
- Scalable for Smart Campus Mobility
- Can expand to multiple routes, attendance tracking, energy monitoring, etc.
